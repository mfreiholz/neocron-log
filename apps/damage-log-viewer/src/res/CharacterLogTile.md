# Character Log
Open your character log and analyze your resist values.

__Example file location:__ `$NEOCRON/logs/<YourCharacter>_00.log`

## How to enable logs?
Neocron doesn't write the required *.log files by default,
but you can enable logging in your game's configuration file.

- Open file `$NEOCRON/neocron.ini`
- Append `ENABLELOG = \"TRUE\"` to the end of file.
- Save file & Start game
